		 <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I begin to
speak about my subject proper let me make a few introductory
remarks.
I feel I shall have great difficulties in communicating my
thoughts to you and I think some of them may be diminished by mentioning
them to you beforehand.
The first one, which almost I need not mention, is, that English is not
my native tongue and my <span property="Language">expression</span> therefore often lacks that precision
and subtlety which would be desirable if one talks
about a difficult subject.
All I can do is to ask you to make my task easier by trying to get at
my <span property="Philosophy">meaning</span> <span style="color: #FF0000;"> in spite</span> of the faults which I will
constantly be committing against the English grammar.
The second difficulty I will mention is this, that probably many of you
come up to this <span property="Science">lecture</span> of mine with slightly wrong expectations.

And to set you right in this point I will say a few <span property="Language">words</span> about the
reason for choosing the subject I have chosen: When your
former secretary honoured me by asking me to read a paper to your
society, my first thought was that I would certainly do it and my second
thought was that if I was to have the opportunity to speak to you I
should speak about something which I am keen on communicating to you and
that I should not misuse this opportunity to give you a <span property="Science">lecture</span> about,
say, <span property="Diverse">logic.</span>
I call this a misuse for to explain a <span property="Science">scientific</span> matter to you it
would need a course of lectures and not an hour's paper.
An other alternative would have been to give you what's called a
popular-scientific <span property="Science">lecture,</span> that is a <span property="Science">lecture</span> intended to make you
believe that you understand a thing which actually you don't
understand, and to gratify what I believe to be one of the lowest desires
of modern people, namely the superficial curiosity about the latest
discoveries of <span property="Science">science.</span>
I rejected these alternatives and decided to talk to you about a
subject which seems to me to be of general importance, hoping that it may
help to clear up your thoughts about this subject (even if you
should

</table> entirely disagree with what I will say
about it).
My third and last difficulty is one which, in fact, adheres to most
lengthy philosophical lectures and it is this, that the hearer is
incapable of seeing both the road he is led and the goal which it leads
to.
That is to say: he either thinks: “I understand
all he says, but what on earth is he driving at” or else he
thinks “I see what he's driving at, but how on earth is
he going to get there”.
All I can do is again to ask you to be patient and to hope that in the
end you may see both the way and where it leads to. ---

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now begin.
		
		 My subject, as you know, is <span property="Ethics">Ethics</span> and I will adopt the
explanation of that term which Prof. Moore has given in his <span property="Language">book</span>
“Principia Ethica”.
He says: “Ethics is the general enquiry into
what is good”.
Now I am going to use the term <span property="Ethics">Ethics</span> in a slightly wider <span property="Philosophy">sense,</span>
in a <span property="Philosophy">sense</span> in fact which includes what I believe to be the most essential
part of what is generally called Aesthetics.
		
		 And to make you see as clearly as possible what I take to be the
subject matter of <span property="Ethics">Ethics</span> I will put before you a number of more or
less synonymous expressions each of which could be substituted for
the above <span property="Language">definition,</span> and by enumerating them I want to produce the same
sort of effect which
Galton produced when he took a number of photos of
different faces on the same photographic plate in order to get the
picture of the typical features they all had in common.
And as by showing to you such a collective photo I could make you see
what is the typical — say — Chinese face;
so if you look through the row of synonyms which I will put before you,
you will, I hope, be able to see the characteristic features they all
have in common and these are the characteristic features of
<span property="Ethics">Ethics.</span>
Now instead of saying “Ethics
is the enquiry into what is good” I could have said
<span property="Ethics">Ethics</span> is the enquiry into what is valuable, or, into what is
really important, or I could have said <span property="Ethics">Ethics</span> is

</table> the enquiry into the <span property="Philosophy">meaning</span> of <span property="Ethics">life,</span> or
into what makes <span property="Ethics">life</span> worth living, or into the right way of
living.
I believe if you look at all these phrases you will get a rough
idea as to what it is that <span property="Ethics">Ethics</span> is concerned with.
Now the first thing that strikes one about all these expressions is
that each of them is actually used in two very different senses.
I will call them the trivial or relative <span property="Philosophy">sense</span> on the one hand
and the ethical or absolute <span property="Philosophy">sense</span> on the other.
If for instance I say that this is a <span style="font-style: italic; ">good</span> chair this means
that the chair serves a certain predetermined purpose and the word <span style="color: #FF0000;">“</span>good<span style="color: #FF0000;">”</span>
here has only <span property="Philosophy">meaning</span> so far as this purpose has been previously
fixed upon.
In fact the word <span style="color: #FF0000;">“</span>good<span style="color: #FF0000;">”</span> in the
relative <span property="Philosophy">sense</span> simply means coming up to a certain predetermined
standard.
Thus when we say that this man is a <span property="Psychological">good</span> pianist we mean that he can
play pieces of a certain degree of difficulty with a certain degree of
dexterity.
And similarly if I say that it is <span style="font-style: italic; ">important</span> for me not to
catch cold I mean that catching a cold produces certain describable
disturbances in my <span property="Ethics">life</span> and if I say that this is the <span style="font-style: italic; ">right</span>
road I mean that it's the right road relative
to a certain goal.
Used in this way these expressions don't present any difficult or
deep problems.
But this is not how <span property="Ethics">Ethics</span> uses them.
Supposing that I could play tennis and one of you saw me playing and
said “well you play pretty badly” and suppose I
answered “I know, I'm playing badly but I don't want
to play any better”, all the other man could say would be
“Ah then that's all right”.
But suppose I had told one of you a preposterous lie and he came up to
me and said “You're behaving like a
beast” and then I were to say “I know I behave
badly, but then I don't want to behave any better”, could
he then say “Ah, then that's all
right”?
Certainly not; he would say “Well, you <span style="font-style: italic; ">ought</span>
to want to behave better”.
Here you have an absolute judgment of <span property="Ethics">value,</span> whereas the first instance
was one of a relative judgment.
The essence of this difference seems to be obviously this:
Every judgment of <span property="Ethics">relative value</span> is a mere statement of

</td>
</tr>
</table> <span property="Language">facts</span> and can therefore be put in such a
form that it loses all the appearance of a judgment of value:
Instead of saying “this is the right way to
Granchester<span style="color: #FF0000;">”</span> I could equally well have
said “this is the right way you have to go if you want to get
to Granchester in the shortest time”,
<span style="color: #FF0000;">“</span>this man is a <span property="Psychological">good</span> runner<span style="color: #FF0000;">”</span>
simply means that he runs a certain number of miles in a certain number
of minutes, and so forth.
Now what I wish to contend is, that although all judgments of relative
<span property="Ethics">value</span> can be shown to be mere statements of <span property="Language">facts,</span> no statement of fact
can ever be, or imply, a judgment of <span style="font-style: italic; ">absolute</span> <span property="Ethics">value.</span>
Let me explain this: Suppose one of you were an omniscient
<span property="Person">person</span> and therefore knew all the movements of all the bodies in the
<span property="Language">world</span> dead or alive and that he also knew all the states of mind of all
human beings that ever lived, and suppose this man wrote all he knew in a
big <span property="Language">book,</span> then this <span property="Language">book</span> would contain the whole description of the
world; and what I want to say is, that this <span property="Language">book</span> would contain nothing
that we would call an <span style="font-style: italic; ">ethical</span> judgment or anything that would
logically imply such a judgment.
It would of course contain all relative judgments of <span property="Ethics">value</span> and all true
<span property="Science">scientific</span> propositions and in fact all true propositions that can be
made.
But all the <span property="Language">facts</span> described would, as it were, stand on the same level
and in the same way all propositions stand on the same level.
There are no propositions which, in any absolute <span property="Philosophy">sense,</span> are sublime,
important, or trivial.
	
Now perhaps some of you will agree to that and be reminded of
Hamlet's words: <span style="color: #FF0000;">“</span>Nothing is either
<span property="Psychological">good</span> or <span property="Psychological">bad,</span> but thinking makes it so”.
But this again could lead to a misunderstanding.
What <span property="Psychological">Hamlet</span>
says seems to imply that <span property="Psychological">good</span> and <span property="Psychological">bad,</span> though not qualities of the <span property="Language">world</span>
outside us, are attributes of our states of mind.
But what I mean is that a state of mind, so far as we mean by that a
fact which we can describe, is in no ethical <span property="Philosophy">sense</span> <span property="Psychological">good</span> or <span property="Psychological">bad.</span>
If for instance in our world-book we read the description of a
murder with all its details physical and <span property="Psychological">psychological</span> the mere
description of these <span property="Language">facts</span> will contain nothing which we could call an

</td>

</table> <span style="font-style: italic; ">ethical</span> proposition.
The murder will be on exactly the same level as any other event, for
instance the falling of a stone.
Certainly the reading of this description might cause us pain or rage
or any other <span property="Ethics">emotion,</span> or we might read about the pain or rage caused by
this murder in other people when they heard of it, but there will simply
be <span property="Language">facts,</span> <span property="Language">facts</span> and <span property="Language">facts</span> but no <span property="Ethics">Ethics.</span> —
And now I must say that if I contemplate what <span property="Ethics">Ethics</span> really would
have to be if there were such a <span property="Science">science,</span> this result seems to me quite
obvious.
It seems to me obvious that nothing we could ever think or say should
be <span style="">the</span> thing.
That we cannot write a <span property="Science">scientific</span> <span property="Language">book,</span> the subject matter of which
could be intrinsically sublime and above all other subject
matters.
I can only describe my feeling by the <span property="Language">metaphor,</span> that, if a man
could write a <span property="Language">book</span> on <span property="Ethics">Ethics</span> which really was a <span property="Language">book</span> on <span property="Ethics">Ethics,</span>
this <span property="Language">book</span> would, with an explosion, destroy all the other books in the

Our <span property="Language">words</span> used as we use them in <span property="Science">science,</span> are vessels capable only of
containing and conveying <span property="Philosophy">meaning</span> and <span property="Philosophy">sense,</span> <span style="font-style: italic; ">natural</span> <span property="Philosophy">meaning</span>

were to pour out a gallon
over it. ---
I said that so far as <span property="Language">facts</span> and
propositions are concerned there is only <span property="Ethics">relative value</span> and
relative <span property="Psychological">good,</span> right etc.
And let me, before I go on, illustrate this by a rather
obvious example.
The right road is the road which leads to an arbitrarily predetermined
end and it is quite clear to us all that there is no <span property="Philosophy">sense</span> in talking
about the right road apart from such a predetermined goal.
Now let us see what we could possibly mean by the <span property="Language">expression</span>
“<span style="font-style: italic; ">the</span> absolutely right road”.
I think it would be the road which <span style="font-style: italic; ">everybody</span> on seeing
it would, <span style="font-style: italic; ">with logical necessity</span> have to go, or be ashamed for
not going.
And similarly the <span style="font-style: italic; ">absolute</span> <span style="font-style: italic; ">good</span>, if it is a
describable state of affairs would be one which everybody, independent of
his tastes and inclinations, would <span style="font-style: italic; ">necessarily</span> bring about or
feel guilty for not bringing about.
And I want to say that such a state of affairs is a chimera.
No state of affairs has in itself,

</table> what I would like to call, the coercive
power of an absolute judge. —
Then what have all of us who, like myself, are still tempted to use
such expressions as “absolute good”,
“absolute value” etc.,
what have we in mind and what do we try to express?
Now whenever I try to make this clear to myself it is natural that I
should recall cases in which I would certainly use these expressions and
I am then in the situation and in which you would be if, for instance, I
were to give you a <span property="Science">lecture</span> on the psychology of pleasure.
What you would do then would be to try and recall some typical
situation in which you always felt pleasure.
For, bearing this situation in mind, all I should say to you would
become concrete and, as it were, controllable.
One man would perhaps choose as his stock example the sensation
when taking a walk on a fine summer's day.
Now in this situation I am if I want to fix my mind on what I mean by
absolute or ethical <span property="Ethics">value.</span>
And there, in my case, it always happens that the idea of one
particular experience presents itself to me which therefore is, in a
<span property="Philosophy">sense,</span> my experience <span style="color: #FF0000;"> par</span> excellence and
this is the reason why, in talking to you now, I will use this experience
as my first and foremost example.
(As I have said before, this is an entirely personal matter and
others would find other examples more striking<span style="color: #FF0000;">.</span>)
I will describe this experience in order, if possible, to make
you recall the same or similar experiences, so that we may have a common
ground for our investigation.
I believe the best way of describing it is to say that when I
have it <span style="font-style: italic; ">I wonder at the existence of the world.</span>
And I am then inclined to use such phrases as “how
extraordinary that anything should exist” or
“how extraordinary that the <span property="Language">world</span> should
exist”.
		
		 I will mention another experience straight away which I also know
and which others of you might be acquainted with: it is, what one
might call, the experience of feeling <span style="font-style: italic; ">absolutely</span> safe.
I mean the state of mind in which one is inclined to say
“I am safe, nothing can injure me whatever
happens”.
Now let me consider these experiences, for, I believe, they exhibit the
very characteristics we try to get clear about.
And there

</table> the first thing I have to say is, that
the verbal <span property="Language">expression</span> which we give to these experiences is
nonsense!
If I say “I wonder at the existence of the
world” I am misusing <span property="Language">language.</span>
Let me explain this: It has a perfectly <span property="Psychological">good</span> and clear
<span property="Philosophy">sense</span> to say that <span property="Philosophy">I wonder</span> at something being the case, we all understand
what it means to say that <span property="Philosophy">I wonder</span> at the size of a dog which is bigger
than anyone I have ever seen before or at any thing which, in the common
<span property="Philosophy">sense</span> of the word, is extraordinary.
In every such case <span property="Philosophy">I wonder</span> at something being the case which I
<span style="font-style: italic; ">could</span> conceive <span style="font-style: italic; ">not</span> to be the case.
<span property="Philosophy">I wonder</span> at the size of this dog because I could conceive of a
dog of another, namely the ordinary size, at which I should not
wonder.
To say “I wonder at such and such being the
case” has only <span property="Philosophy">sense</span> if I can imagine it not to be
the case.
In this <span property="Philosophy">sense</span> one can wonder at the existence of, say, a house when one
sees it and has not visited it for a long time and has imagined that it
had been pulled down in the meantime.
But it is nonsense to say that <span property="Philosophy">I wonder</span> at the existence of the <span property="Language">world,</span>
because I cannot imagine it not existing.
I could of course wonder at the <span property="Language">world</span> round me being as it
is.
If for instance I had this experience while looking into the blue sky,
I could wonder at the sky being blue as opposed to the case when it's
clouded.
But that's not what I mean.
I am wondering at the sky being <span style="font-style: italic; ">whatever it is.</span>
One might be tempted to say that what I am wondering at is a
tautology, namely at the sky being
blue or not blue.
But then it's just nonsense to say that one is wondering at a
tautology.
Now the same applies to the other experience which I have
mentioned, the experience of absolute safety.
We all know what it means in ordinary <span property="Ethics">life</span> to be safe.
I am safe in my room, when I cannot be run over by an
omnibus.
I am safe if I have had whooping cough and cannot
therefore get it again.
To be safe essentially means that it is physically impossible
that certain things should happen to me and therefore it's nonsense
to say that I am safe <span style="font-style: italic; ">whatever</span> happens.
Again this is a misuse of the word “safe” as
the other example was a misuse of the word
“existence” or
“wondering”.
Now I want to impress on you that a certain characteristic misuse of
our <span property="Language">language</span> runs

</table> through <span style="font-style: italic; ">all</span> ethical and
<span property="Religion">religious</span> expressions.
All these expressions <span style="font-style: italic; ">seem</span>, prima facie, to be just
<span style="font-style: italic; ">similes</span>.
Thus it seems that when we are using the word <span style="font-style: italic; ">right</span> in an
ethical <span property="Philosophy">sense,</span> although, what we mean, is not right in its trivial <span property="Philosophy">sense,</span>
it's something similar, and when we say “this is a <span property="Psychological">good</span>
fellow”, although the word
<span style="color: #FF0000;">“</span>good<span style="color: #FF0000;">”</span> here doesn't mean
what it means in the sentence “this is a <span property="Psychological">good</span> football
player” there seems to be some similarity.
And when we say “this man's <span property="Ethics">life</span> was valuable”
we don't mean it in the same <span property="Philosophy">sense</span> in which we would speak of some
valuable jewelry but there seems to be some sort of analogy.
Now all <span property="Religion">religious</span> terms seem in this <span property="Philosophy">sense</span> to be used as similes or
allegorically.
For when we speak of God and that he
sees everything and when we kneel and pray to him all our terms and
actions seem to be parts of a great and elaborate allegory which
represents him as a human being of great power whose grace we try to win
etc. etc.
But this allegory also describes the experience which I have just
referred to.
For, the first of them is, I believe, exactly what people were
referring to when they said that God had
created the world; and the experience of absolute safety has been
described by saying that we feel safe in the hands of God.
A third experience of the same kind is that of feeling guilty and again
this was described by the phrase that God
disapproves of our conduct.
Thus in ethical and <span property="Religion">religious</span> <span property="Language">language</span> we seem constantly to be using
similes.
But a simile must be the simile for <span style="font-style: italic; ">something.</span>
And if I can describe a fact by means of a simile I must also be able
to drop the simile and to describe the <span property="Language">facts</span> without it.
Now in our case as soon as we try to drop the simile and simply to
state the <span property="Language">facts</span> which stand behind it, we find, that there are no such
<span property="Language">facts.</span>
And so, what at first appeared to be a simile, now
seems to be mere nonsense. — </span><br>&nbsp;</div>

Now the three experiences which I have mentioned to you (and I could
have added others) seem to those who have experienced them, for
instance to me, to have in some <span property="Philosophy">sense</span> an intrinsic, absolute
<span property="Ethics">value.</span>
But when I say they are experiences, surely, they are facts; they have
taken place then and there, lasted a certain

</table> definite time and consequently are
describable.
And so from what I have said some minutes ago I must admit it is
nonsense to say that they have absolute <span property="Ethics">value.</span>
And I will make my point still more acute by saying “it is
the paradox that an experience, a fact, should seem to have <span property="Ethics">supernatural</span>
value<span style="color: #FF0000;">”</span>.
Now there is a way in which I would be tempted to meet this
paradox.
Let me first consider, again, our first experience of wondering at the
existence of the <span property="Language">world</span> and let me describe it in a slightly different
way<span>:</span> We all know what in ordinary <span property="Ethics">life</span> would be
called a miracle.
It obviously is simply an event the like of which we have never yet seen.
Now suppose such an event happened.
Take the case that one of you suddenly grew a lion<span style="color: #FF0000;">'</span>s head
and began to roar.
Certainly that would be as extraordinary a thing as I can
imagine.
Now whenever we should have recovered from our surprise, what I would
suggest would be to fetch a doctor and have the case scientifically
investigated and if it were not for hurting him I would have him
vivisected.
And where would the miracle have got to?
For it is clear that when we look at it in this way everything
miraculous has disappeared; unless what we mean by this term is
merely that a fact has not yet been explained by <span property="Science">science</span> which again
means that we have hitherto failed to group this fact with others in a
<span property="Science">scientific</span> system.
This shows that it is absurd to say “science has proved
that there are no miracles”.
The truth is that the <span property="Science">scientific</span> way of looking at a fact is not the
way to look at it as a miracle.
For imagine whatever fact you may, it is not in itself miraculous in
the absolute <span property="Philosophy">sense</span> of that term.
For we see now that we have been using the word
“miracle” in a relative and an absolute
<span property="Philosophy">sense.</span>
And I will now describe the experience of wondering at the existence of
the <span property="Language">world</span> by saying: it is the experience of seeing the <span property="Language">world</span> as a
miracle.
Now I am tempted to say that the right <span property="Language">expression</span> in <span property="Language">language</span> for the
miracle of the existence of the <span property="Language">world,</span> though it is not any proposition
<span style="font-style: italic; ">in</span> <span property="Language">language,</span> is the existence of <span property="Language">language</span> itself.
But what then does it mean

</table> to be aware of this miracle at some
times and not at other times<span>?</span>
For all I have said by shifting the <span property="Language">expression</span> of the miraculous from
an <span property="Language">expression</span> <span style="font-style: italic; ">by means of</span> <span property="Language">language</span> to the <span property="Language">expression</span> <span style="font-style: italic; ">by
the existence</span> of <span property="Language">language,</span> all I have said is again that we cannot
express what we want to express and that all we <span style="font-style: italic; ">say</span> about the
absolute miraculous remains nonsense. —
Now the answer to all this will seem perfectly clear to many of
you.
You will say: Well, if certain experiences constantly tempt
us to attribute a quality to them which we call absolute or ethical <span property="Ethics">value</span>
and importance, this simply shows that by these <span property="Language">words</span> we
<span style="font-style: italic; ">don't</span> mean nonsense, that after all what we mean by saying
that an experience has <span property="Ethics">absolute value</span> <span style="font-style: italic; ">is just a fact like other
facts</span> and that all it comes to is that we have not yet succeeded in
finding the correct logical analysis of what we mean by our ethical and
<span property="Religion">religious</span> expressions. —
Now when this is urged against me I at once see clearly, as it were in
a flash of light, not only that no description that I can think of would
do to describe what I mean by absolute <span property="Ethics">value,</span> but that I would reject
every significant description that anybody could possibly suggest,
<span style="font-style: italic; ">ab initio</span>, on the ground of its significance.
That is to say: I see now that these nonsensical expressions were
not nonsensical because I had not yet found the correct expressions, but
that their nonsensicality was their very essence.
For all I wanted to do with them was just <span style="font-style: italic; ">to go beyond</span> the
<span property="Language">world</span> and that is to say beyond significant <span property="Language">language.</span>
My whole tendency and I believe the tendency of all men who ever tried
to write or talk <span property="Ethics">Ethics</span> or <span property="Religion">Religion</span> was to run against the
boundaries of <span property="Language">language.</span>
This running against the walls of our cage is perfectly, absolutely
hopeless. —
<span property="Ethics">Ethics</span> so far as it springs from the desire to say something about the
ultimate <span property="Philosophy">meaning</span> of <span property="Ethics">life,</span> the absolute <span property="Psychological">good,</span> the absolute valuable, can
be no <span property="Science">science.</span>
What it says does not add to our knowledge in any <span property="Philosophy">sense.</span>
But it is a document of a tendency in the human mind which I personally
cannot help respecting deeply and I would not for my <span property="Ethics">life</span> ridicule
it. </span><br>&nbsp;</div>
